# Suricata on Amazon EC2
Suricata is an open source threat detection engine that combines intrusion detection (IDS), intrusion prevention (IPS), network security monitoring (NSM) and PCAP processing.
We can use Suricata for threat detection by leveraging the VPC Traffic Mirroring Feature. 
By Traffic Mirroring a copy of Amazon VPC traffic flows is sent to a set of EC2 instances (behind an NLB) with Suricata engine aboard.
